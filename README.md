## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Citizen Grievance Portal
- **Instant Complaint Filing**: Submit complaints with category selection (Water Supply, Sanitation / Waste, Electricity, Roads & Potholes, Street Lights, etc.).
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Track any grievance using its unique Tracking ID (e.g., `#CMP1001`) with timeline stages (Submitted → Under Review → Assigned to Officer → Resolved).
- **Citizen Ledger**: View all complaints filed by your mobile number or email in one unified list.
- **Priority & Location Tagging**: Specify ward numbers, landmark addresses, and issue urgency.

### 2. Official Municipal Staff Dashboard (`Office Dashboard`)
- **Executive KPI Analytics**: High-level metrics for total complaints, pending inspections, active in-progress works, verified resolutions, and resolution rate (%).
- **Public Information Dossier**: Full citizen information displayed for every grievance:
  - Complainant Citizen Name & Contact Details
  - Direct 1-Click Phone Dialer (`tel:`) & Email Dispatch (`mailto:`)
  - Locality / Ward jurisdiction & issue breakdown
- **Action Taken Report (ATR) Workflow**: Update complaint status (`Pending` → `In Progress` → `Resolved`), assign designated officers, and record official resolution remarks.
- **Citizen Directory**: Aggregated citizen records with complaint histories and direct outreach tools.
- **Export & Print**: Export complaints to CSV for official municipal registers or generate print-friendly work orders.

### 3. Real-Time Firebase Sync & Zero-Downtime Resilience
- **Google Firebase Firestore**: Real-time snapshot synchronization across all active devices.
- **Offline & First-Load Fallbacks**: Pre-seeded demo dataset ensures the app runs smoothly with zero blank-screen failures, even before network initialization.
- **Built-in Error Boundary**: Gracefully catches any unexpected runtime issues with one-click reload and cache reset utilities.

### 4. Master Developer Console
- Secure administrative portal to generate official staff accounts with custom Staff IDs, designation, department, and secure 4-digit PINs.
- Real-time Firestore database stats and manual seed management.
